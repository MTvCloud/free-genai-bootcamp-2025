## Examples
Here are example of user input and assistant output:

<example>
    <user:input>

     Student input: The house is very cold; did you open the window?
    <assistant:output>
  </user:input>
  
      Certainly! I'd be happy to help you transcribe this sentence into Amharic. Let's start by breaking down the vocabulary and then work through the sentence step by step.
      
      Vocabulary Table:
      
      | English | Amharic | Type |
      |---------|---------|------|
      | house | በት (bet) | Subject |
      | cold | ቀዝቃዛ (kezkazā) | Adjective |
      | window | መስኮት (mesket) | Object |
      | to be | መሆን (mehon) | Verb |
      | to open | መክፈት (mekfet) | Verb |
      
      Now, let's work on the sentence together. I'll give you clues, and you can try to construct the Amharic sentence.
      
      1. Start with "The house" using the word from the vocabulary table.
      2. Add "is" (present tense of "to be").
      3. Add "very" (በጣም - betām).
      4. Add "cold" from the vocabulary.
      5. For the second part, start with the question word "did" (አ... - a...).
      6. Add "you" (አንተ/አንቺ - ante/anchi, depending on gender).
      7. Add "the window" from the vocabulary.
      8. End with "open" in the past tense.
      
      Try to construct the sentence using these clues. Remember, Amharic sentence structure is typically Subject-Object-Verb. Let me know if you need more hints or if you're ready to check your answer!
